# A new Magento community in the Netherlands


**Mage-OS Netherlands is an association that supports the Dutch Magento community. Mage-OS Nederland takes its name from [Mage-OS](https://mage-os.org/), a worldwide open initiative for the preservation of Magento Open Source (where *Mage* is a copyright-free corruption of Magento and *OS* stands for Open Source).**

## About this initiative {#over}

### Background
Mage-OS Netherlands is an initiative by some community members to revive the Dutch community - after a few years of relative inactivity.

### Progress
The idea is to first set up an association (with the initiators as interim board), then organize a members meeting and then embrace further community initiatives (such as Dutch events, a better website, information provision to online retailers and much more).

All help is welcome, so one of the first tasks of the interim board will be to start an organizational form through which all kinds of possible initiatives can be immediately embraced.
